# Frontend Take-Home Exercise

Built using React.js

Yup - To build the frontend form-validation schema.

Formik - I used formik because it's a time saver and streamlines the form creation process in React.js. Formik has a special prop for entering yup schemas directly, speeding up the process and the browser. Also Formik has a built in property for rendering error messages directly to the user.

## Styling 

I used CSS for styling making use of psuedo elements for the 'create account' button. 

I created all the gradients using https://cssgradient.io/. 

Normalize.css was used to clean up the code.

## Functionality

Straight forward create user form. All fields must be complete to submit. Each field validates input in real time. 
occupations and states were fetched from the given api. states name / abbreviation were joined into a single string. 

Tooltip appears with either a success or fail message upon submission.
